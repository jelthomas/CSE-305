Extra Credit:

For every .jsp file, I added a nav bar that contains the centered, underlined text of the heading (Ex: Home screen has a nav bar of "Welcome to the Online Travel Reservation System!"). For the home screen for customer, customer rep, and manager, I added a second row in order to neatly represent all user options. This reduced clutter and made all buttons fit within its respective container. All containers on the home screens are centered as well as the buttons. This eliminated the buttons overflowing out of the container.
